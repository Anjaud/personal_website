          <h2>Hellou! My name is Anna-Maria.</h2>
          <p>
            After finishing my high school diploma, I wasn’t sure which direction to take.
            First, I tried getting into marketing, then I considered studying psychology at university, but neither of these paths worked out. So, I decided to gain some experience and worked at a hotel reception. While I learned a lot, I realized it wasn’t a long-term fit for me, so I took some time to reflect on my future goals and how to achieve them.
            During this time, I kept finding myself drawn to the tech field. Even back in high school, I had an interest in computer science, media informatics, design, and marketing – but more on the creative side. Over time, my interest in the technical side of things grew. Social media further fueled this interest, as I started coming across content from software developers, cybersecurity specialists, and data analysts. But where do I start?
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to revisit something I had done years ago: programming a website. I enrolled in an online web development course and just started coding. Now, I’ve created my first project – this website. My motivation to learn more has led me to start learning JavaScript, and I’m eager to dive even deeper into the field.
          </p>

          <p>
            But it’s not just programming that excites me – I’ve always been passionate about creativity and bringing ideas to life through design. Since childhood, I’ve enjoyed being creative, and as an adult, it’s become important for me to continue expressing this side of myself. I do this through my art, which I share on my social media channel @annmartist, combining my creativity with my technical skills.

          <h2>My portfolio website</h2>
          <p>This project was born out of my desire to apply the knowledge from my web developement course and create something that has real purpose for me.</p>

          <p>For the developement of my website, I used HTML and CSS. I reinforced my unterstanding of HTML structure  and utilized div-containers to create a clear layout that supports my unique design.</p>

          <p>With CSS, I defined the styling of my website and used Flexbox and grid to organize the layout into different sections. Additionally, I implemented Media Queries to ensure the site is  responsible and adapts to different screen sizes.</p>
